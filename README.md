# COVID-19-pandemic-prediction
In this, I have investigated the problem of COVID-19 spread on a global scale and also in various countries and their states/provinces. I used a ML model from a marketing paper by Emmanuelle le Nagard and Alexandre Steyer attempts to reflect the social structure of a diffusion process. Their application was the diffusion of innovations, not epidemics. However, there are commonalities in both domains, as the number of contacts each infected person/ innovation adopter has seemed relevant. It also has the added benefit to allow fitting parameters to the beginning of a time series., which follows the actual data trend of COVID-19 spread.
